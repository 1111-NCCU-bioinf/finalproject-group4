# How to use this project?

### Tips1: 
Please directly press `Run All` buttom in each notebook, the code will automatly execute, and the result will be printed under the notebook cells. There are more informations written in the notebook, go and check it!

### Tips2: 
`correlation_based.ipynb`, `fold_change_based.ipynb`, `significance_based.ipynb` this three notebook will output there model prediction result csv files into the `/results/output` folder, and output AUC score of each model to `/results/AUC` folder, you may want to check it.

### Tips3:
After execute `correlation_based.ipynb`, `fold_change_based.ipynb`, `significance_based.ipynb` three notebooks at least once and make sure that the AUC scores are correctly output to `/results/AUC` folder, than you can press the `Run All` buttom in `AUC_table.ipynb` to see the AUC camparision table for all 8 classification models.
